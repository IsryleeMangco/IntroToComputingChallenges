    <h2>About my self as 1st year in bsInformationSystem</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! I'm thrilled to be a first-year student in the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I'm Isrylee, and my fascination with technology led me to this exciting field. From coding to understanding how information flows, every day is a new adventure. When I'm not immersed in lectures and labs, you can find me [Your Hobbies or Activities]. I believe that technology has the power to transform the world, and I'm eager to be part of that change. Here's to embracing the challenges and learning experiences that come my way!</p>
